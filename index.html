    <p>Families and the role women play in them are changing rapidly. Women are getting married later in life at an increasing rate.  This change -- as well as others -- is a consequence, in part, of dramatic shifts in rights, education, and employment.  Women and men across the word are delaying marriage.  This has resulted in women being able to complete their education and subsequently support themselves financially.

  <p>In some countries, more women are opting out of marriage completely.  This decision can be influenced out of necessity if the cost of raising a family is too high.  This can also reflect a growing reluctance to be in relationships where women are expected to take on a more submissive role.
